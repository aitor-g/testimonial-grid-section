        <div class="testimonials__testimony-body_text">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
          been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
          the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched
          careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</div>

        <div class="testimonials__testimony-body_text">" Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code.
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encourage to
          enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
          curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
          tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! "</div>
